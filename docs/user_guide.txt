___ Overview ___

Topic Fu is designed to be a flexible, fun to user discussion board. Users can sign up with a name and password, 
create, edit and view topics, and share comments. Some added features allow easy navigation throughout the site, 
including search and a module listing recently updated topics. Usability is improved by a friendly design and 
unobtrusive javascript enhancements, like the fading flash messages and animated form controls.

___ Key Features ___

[Signup & Login]

  When first arriving at the site, new users are redirected to the login page, where they will find a link to 
  sign up in welcome box in the top right corner. Signing up is as easy as providing a name and email to register. 
  This information is used to track user contributions on the discussion board. The signup area. "Teaser" links to 
  existing topics are overridden by a javascript alert encouraging visitors to sign up. Email input is validated 
  for proper format. After sign up, the new user is redirected to the Topic Fu homepage with a welcome flash message. 
  An existing user arriving at the login page provides her name and email to log in again. Her login is verified 
  against the existing information.
  
[Edit and Preview]

  The edit and preview functionality behaves as it did with the My Topic project with some added improvements. 
  Topic authors can now insert URLs to images, create ordered and unordered lists.

  - item x
  - item y
  - item z
  ]  
  
  {                     // ordered list of three list items
  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3
  }
  
  ! image-url !         // image tag with url as src attribute
  
  Another added bonus: Existing topics are auto-hyperlinked to their corresponding view pages with additional work 
  from the author.
  
[View page]
  
  The view page for each topic now contains additional navigation to foster user dialogue. The view nav contains a 
  link directly to the edit page for the topic. 
  
  User Comments
  
  There is also a link to reveal an inline comment form where users can append content that is associated with the 
  topic, their name. While the topic is anonymous by design (intended to be a collective user thread, a la aa wiki), 
  the comments allow for discussion and back and forth, ideally to improve the content of the topic overall. 
  Formatting rules for comment authors also apply, so the comments can be equally as robust as the topics themselves. 
  Comments are listed from most recent to earliest on the same page as the topic.
  
  Previous Revisions
  
  Users can also view earlier revisions of topics. All previous revisions are available for comparison in a select 
  menu revealed when clicking on the 'Compare' link. Recently updated versions of the post are also directly linked 
  through the side bar available on the view page. These are also listed from most recent to earliest, with the 
  latest topic filtered out.
  
  Compare page
  
  Users can view a `diff` output by selecting a revision through the 'Compare' link while viewing any existing 
  revision of a topic.
  
[Search]

  Available on all logged-in pages is the Search box on the top right. The search functionality returns topics 
  that contain the terms entered for the search. The results are ordered by score, based on word usage. The scoring 
  system is a basic algorithm that counts 1 point for each instance of the keyword and applies a multiplier when 
  matches are made on the topic title.
