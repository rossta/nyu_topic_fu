Story: Final Assignment - Topic Fu
  
  As an NYU student
  I want to view and edit topics online
  So that I can share information with other students

  Baseline Project:
  * Extend the ascii formatting in several dimensions:
        o Any reference to another wiki topic gets turned into a link
        o Support for bulleted lists, paragraph breaks
        o Support for images (ability to specify an image link that is turned into an image when viewed or previewed)
  * Allow a user to see each revision of a topic
  * Allow two revisions of a topic to be selected and show the differences between them
  * Search for keywords across all topics
  * List recently edited topics
  
  Extended Project (Ideas):
  * Provide a way to create user accounts.  The user accounts will be used to associate surveys and votes with a particular user.
  * Lock a document so it cannot be edited by two people at a time
  * Record each time a topic is viewed, show most popular topics
  * Notifications: allow an email address to be notified when a new topic is created and/or when a given topic is edited.
  * Allow discussions on a topic, or ratings on topics
  * Add an RSS feed
  * Provide templates that can be used to start a new topic
  * Other statistics: most edited documents, most frequent contributors (if there are user accounts), etc.
  * Spelling correction
  * Support for attachments, including uploaded images
  
  Documentation
  * a user guide to your program, which describes how to use the program;
  * a developers guide that explains how the project is designed and coded
